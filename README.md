# Memory Card Game

While a student at Tech Talent South we were tasked with creating a project that challenged us to
create an application using JavaScript and JavaScript DOM. I chose to create a Pokemon memory card game.

The memory card game matches two pairs of cards by their images. When you click on a card the card flips over and reveals a Pokemon on the other side. Match the card with its pair by clicking on another card to reveal if there is a match. If there is a match the cards will lock in place. Continue this until all cards have been flipped over and locked in place. Once you have matched all the cards with their pairs press the reset button to reset the board.
